Hi, Iâ€™m a final year undergraduate student from School of Mathematics, UESTC. I will begin my Ph.D. studies at the the Institute of Automation, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2025, under the supervision of Prof. [Changsheng Xu](https://nlpr-web.ia.ac.cn/mmc/homepage/csxu.html) and Prof. [Xiaoshan Yang](https://yangxs.ac.cn/).

My current research interests are mainly focused on Visual Grounding, multimodal learning and deep learning.
